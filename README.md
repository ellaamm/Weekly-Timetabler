# Weekly-Timetabler
Created a timetabling app.
Takes in tasks as an input; as well as the due date. 
It then splits the task into manageable sizes over days prior to the due date. It also provides a reminder and allows for tasks to be checked off. 
Created in order to improve my time management skills.
